Create custom reports to track API calls based on services, routes, or
applications.

{:.note}
> **Note:** If you select multiple service versions in a report, the report
shows the sum of requests for all selected versions broken down by service.
It does not show data points for individual service versions.

To access all custom reports, open {% konnect_icon analytics %}
**Analytics** from the left-side menu in {{site.konnect_short_name}}, then **Reports**.
This brings you to a list of all custom reports in the organization.
